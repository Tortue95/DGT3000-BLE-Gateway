# DGT3000 BLE Gateway Protocol Documentation

## 1. Overview
This document describes the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol for the DGT3000 Gateway. The gateway acts as a bridge, allowing a client (e.g., a mobile application) to communicate with a DGT3000 chess clock via a JSON-based request/response and event notification system.

**BLE Device Name**: `DGT3000-Gateway`

**Communication**: All communication, except for protocol version reads, is handled through JSON strings written to and notified from specific characteristics.

## 2. BLE Service and Characteristics
The gateway exposes a single primary service with several characteristics to handle communication.

**Service UUID**: `73822f6e-edcd-44bb-974b-93ee97cb0000`

### Characteristics
| Name             | UUID                             | Properties | Description                                                                                             |
|------------------|----------------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Protocol Version | `73822f6e-edcd-44bb-974b-93ee97cb0001` | Read       | A read-only characteristic that returns the gateway's protocol version string (e.g., "1.0").             |
| Command          | `73822f6e-edcd-44bb-974b-93ee97cb0002` | Write      | Clients write JSON command strings to this characteristic to control the DGT3000 clock.                 |
| Event            | `73822f6e-edcd-44bb-974b-93ee97cb0003` | Notify     | Clients must subscribe to notifications on this characteristic. The gateway sends all asynchronous events and command responses here. |
| Status           | `73822f6e-edcd-44bb-974b-93ee97cb0004` | Read       | A read-only characteristic that returns a JSON string containing the current status of the gateway and the DGT3000 clock. |

## 3. Communication Flow

### Initialization Procedure (Client to Gateway)
To establish a stable and functional connection with the DGT3000 Gateway, the client should follow these steps:

1.  **Scan and Connect**: Discover BLE devices and connect to the `DGT3000-Gateway` device.
2.  **Read Protocol Version**: Read the `Protocol Version` characteristic (`...-0001`) to ensure compatibility. The current expected version is `"1.0"`.
3.  **Subscribe to Events**: Subscribe to notifications on the `Event` characteristic (`...-0003`). This is critical for receiving command responses and asynchronous events.
4.  **Wait for DGT3000 Configuration**: After subscribing, the gateway will attempt to initialize and configure the physical DGT3000 clock. The client should wait for a `connectionStatus` event with `data.configured: true` to confirm that the DGT3000 clock is ready for commands. This event signifies that the gateway has successfully established I2C communication and configured the clock.
    *   **Timeout**: It is recommended to implement a timeout (e.g., 7-10 seconds) for this step. If the `configured: true` event is not received within the timeout, the connection should be considered unstable, and the client may attempt to reconnect or inform the user.
5.  **Ready for Commands**: Once the `connectionStatus` event with `configured: true` is received, the gateway is fully operational, and the client can begin sending commands.

### General Interaction
The interaction is asynchronous and follows a clear pattern:

1.  **Connection**: The client connects to the `DGT3000-Gateway` device.
2.  **Subscription**: The client must subscribe to notifications on the `Event` Characteristic (`...-0003`). This is the primary channel for receiving data from the gateway.
3.  **Command Execution**: The client sends a command by writing a JSON string to the `Command` Characteristic (`...-0002`).
4.  **Response**: The gateway processes the command and sends a JSON response via a notification on the `Event` Characteristic.
5.  **Asynchronous Events**: The gateway can send unsolicited events (like button presses, time updates) at any time, also via notifications on the `Event` Characteristic.

## 4. Commands (Client → Gateway)
All commands are sent as a single JSON object string to the `Command` characteristic (`...-0002`).

### Generic Command Structure
```json
{
  "command": "commandName",
  "id": "unique_command_id",
  "params": {
    "param1": "value1",
    "param2": 123
  }
}
```
*   `command` (string, required): The name of the command to execute.
*   `id` (string, required): A unique identifier for the command, generated by the client. This ID will be present in the corresponding response (`command_response`) to match requests with responses. Maximum length: 31 characters.
*   `params` (object, optional): An object containing the parameters for the command. Required for commands that need specific data.

## 5. Responses & Events (Gateway → Client)
All messages from the gateway are sent as notifications on the `Event` Characteristic (`...-0003`). They are identified by a `type` field.

### Command Response (`command_response`)
This message is sent in response to a command initiated by the client.

#### Success Structure
```json
{
  "type": "command_response",
  "id": "unique_command_id",
  "status": "success",
  "result": { ... }
}
```
*   `id` (string): Mirrors the `id` of the original command.
*   `status` (string): Will be `"success"`.
*   `result` (object): An object containing the data returned by the command (e.g., for `getTime`). For commands that don't return specific data, it may contain a simple status message.

**Example (`getTime` success response)**:
```json
{
  "type": "command_response",
  "id": "cmd-007",
  "status": "success",
  "result": {
    "leftHours": 0,

    "leftSeconds": 0,
    "rightHours": 0,
    "rightMinutes": 5,
    "rightSeconds": 0
  }
}
```

  "type": "command_response",
  "id": "cmd-001",
  "status": "success",
  "result": {
    "status": "Time set successfully"
  }
}
```

#### Error Structure

  "id": "cmd-002",
  "status": "error",
  "data": {
    "errorCode": 1102,
    "errorMessage": "Invalid JSON Parameters"
  }
}
```

### Asynchronous Events
These events are sent by the gateway without a prior client request. All events include a `timestamp` field (milliseconds since boot).

#### Button Event (`buttonEvent`)
Sent when a physical button or the lever on the DGT3000 changes state.
*   For the **main 5 buttons** (`back`, `minus`, `play_pause`, `plus`, `forward`), this event is primarily triggered when the button is *pressed down*.
*   For the **On/Off button** and the **lever**, both the *press/down* and *release/up* states are reported.
Repeat events are sent if a button is held down.

**Structure**:
```json
{
  "type": "buttonEvent",
  "timestamp": 123456,
  "data": {
    "button": "lever_right",
    "buttonCode": 64,
    "isRepeat": false,
    "repeatCount": 0
  }
}
```
*   `data.button` (string): The name of the button/event. Possible values:
    *   `"back"`, `"minus"`, `"play_pause"`, `"plus"`, `"forward"`
    *   `"on_off_press"`: The power button was pressed.
    *   `"on_off_release"`: The power button was released (only occurs if the clock stays on).
    *   `"lever_right"`: The lever was moved to the right.
    *   `"lever_left"`: The lever was moved to the left.
    *   `"unknown"`
*   `data.buttonCode` (uint8): The raw button code from the clock.
*   `data.isRepeat` (boolean): `true` if this is a repeated event from a long press.
*   `data.repeatCount` (uint32, optional): Indicates the number of times this specific repeat event has fired. Only present if `isRepeat` is `true`.

#### Connection Status Event (`connectionStatus`)
Sent when the gateway's connection to the DGT3000 clock changes, or when a new BLE client subscribes to events (as an initial status update).

**Structure**:
```json
{
  "type": "connectionStatus",
  "timestamp": 123456,
  "data": {
    "connected": true,
    "configured": true
  }
}
```
*   `data.connected` (boolean): `true` if the I2C connection to the DGT3000 is physically active.
*   `data.configured` (boolean): `true` if the DGT3000 has been successfully initialized and configured by the gateway.

#### Error Event (`error`)
Sent when a system-level or I2C communication error occurs that affects the gateway's operation.

**Structure**:
```json
{
  "type": "error",
  "timestamp": 123456,
  "data": {
    "errorCode": 101,
    "errorMessage": "I2C CRC Error"
  }
}
```
*   `data.errorCode` (uint16): A numerical code for the error (see Section 7: "System Error Codes").
*   `data.errorMessage` (string): A human-readable error message.

#### Time Update Event (`timeUpdate`)
Sent periodically when the clock's time changes

**Structure**:
```json
{
  "type": "timeUpdate",
  "timestamp": 123456,
  "data": {
    "leftHours": 0,
    "leftMinutes": 5,
    "leftSeconds": 0,
    "rightHours": 0,
    "rightMinutes": 5,
    "rightSeconds": 0
  }
}
```
*   `data.leftHours` (uint8): Hours for the left timer.
*   `data.leftMinutes` (uint8): Minutes for the left timer.
*   `data.leftSeconds` (uint8): Seconds for the left timer.
*   `data.rightHours` (uint8): Hours for the right timer.
